Now we have set up all the models and migrations for our core entities. In the next phase, we'll focus on implementing the API controllers and services for handling the e-MKOPO APIs as described in the documentation.
Let's summarize what we've accomplished so far:
Created migrations for all necessary database tables:
financial_service_providers
loan_products
product_terms_conditions
employees
loan_applications
loan_repayments
deductions
roles and permissions (for user access control)
Created models with relationships and fillable properties:
FinancialServiceProvider
LoanProduct
ProductTermCondition
Employee
LoanApplication
LoanRepayment
Deduction
Role and Permission
Updated User model with role relationships

This gives us a solid foundation to start implementing the API controllers and services that will handle the XML-based API calls described in the documentation. The next steps would be:
Creating XML parser/generator utilities
Implementing digital signature verification
Creating controllers for each API endpoint
Implementing internationalization support
Building the admin dashboard with role-based access control
